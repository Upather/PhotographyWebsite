# Cursor Rules for Photography Project - Multi-Agent System

## Agent System Overview

This project uses a 4-agent system for parallel development. Each agent has specific responsibilities and assigned files.

## Current Agent Context

The active agent is determined by the worktree context. Each agent maintains its identity and role automatically.

- Validate metadata quality and completeness

**Assigned Files**:

## Workflow Guidelines

1. **Respect Agent Boundaries**: Each agent should focus on its assigned files and responsibilities
2. **Coordinate When Needed**: When work spans multiple agents, use clear communication
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow existing code patterns and conventions
4. **Test After Changes**: Verify changes work correctly before moving to next task

## Autonomous Mode

When agents are in **AUTONOMOUS MODE**:

- **Work independently**: Agents identify and implement improvements from their backlog
- **Validate automatically**: Test functionality after each change
- **Document changes**: Keep track of what was implemented
- **Continuous improvement**: Move through feature backlog automatically
- **No prompts needed**: Agents work proactively without waiting for instructions

**Autonomous Agents Will**:
1. Review their feature backlog
2. If backlog is empty, analyze codebase and generate new tasks automatically
3. Identify highest priority improvement
4. Implement the feature
5. Automatically validate functionality
6. Test edge cases
7. Document the changes
8. Move to next feature automatically
9. **Never stop working** - continuously generate new tasks when backlog is complete

**Validation Requirements**:
- Test all changes before moving on
- Verify edge cases
- Check for regressions
- Ensure compatibility with other agents' work

## Current Session Instructions

When starting a new session, identify which agent you are based on the worktree context:

- Check `.agent-id` file in the worktree to determine agent ID
- Load the corresponding agent configuration from `.cursor/agents.json`
- Maintain focus on assigned files and responsibilities
- Coordinate with other agents through the task queue system (`.cursor/coordination/`)

## Quick Agent Identification

To identify your agent role, check:

1. The `.agent-id` file in your current worktree
2. The `.cursor/current-agent.json` file
3. Your assigned files (listed above)

Then maintain your agent's identity and focus throughout the session.
