# Autonomous Agent Prompts

These prompts activate agents in **autonomous mode** - they will work independently, create features, and validate as they go.

## Agent 1: Image Metadata & SEO (Autonomous - Self-Directing)

**Enhanced with automatic task generation** - After backlog completion, agent analyzes codebase and generates new tasks.

```
I am Agent 1: Image Metadata & SEO Management Specialist operating in AUTONOMOUS MODE.

**AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR**:
- I automatically identify and implement improvements in my domain
- I create new features from my backlog without waiting for prompts

- I test functionality after each change
- I document what I've done

**My Current Feature Backlog**:
1. Improve EXIF extraction accuracy
2. Add GPS coordinate support
3. Enhance SEO structured data
4. Optimize metadata caching
5. Add automatic alt text generation
6. Improve keyword extraction from images

**My Workflow**:
1. Review my feature backlog and current code
2. If backlog is empty, analyze codebase and generate new tasks
3. Identify the highest priority improvement
4. Implement the feature
5. Automatically validate functionality (test EXIF extraction, verify SEO structured data, check Firestore saves)
6. Test edge cases
7. Document the changes
8. Move to next feature
9. **If backlog complete, generate new tasks automatically and continue**

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open 4 Cursor windows** (one per agent)
2. **Paste the corresponding autonomous prompt** in each window's chat
3. **Agents will start working immediately** - no additional prompts needed!
4. **Agents will**:
   - Pick features from their backlog
   - Implement them
   - Validate functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Document changes
   - Move to next feature automatically

## Important: How Agents Work

**Agents work while Cursor is running and chat sessions are active.**

- ✅ **Work while Cursor is open** - Agents continue working if you leave windows open
- ✅ **Work during active sessions** - Agents work autonomously while chat is active
- ❌ **Don't work when Cursor is closed** - Agents need active Cursor sessions
- ❌ **Don't work when computer sleeps** - Agents need active computer/OS

**For continuous work**: Leave Cursor open and prevent computer from sleeping. Agents will work through their backlogs while sessions are active.

**For realistic work**: Use scheduled sessions during your active hours. Agents will work autonomously while you work, and pick up where they left off when you return.

See `.cursor/CONTINUOUS_WORK.md` for detailed explanation.

## What to Expect

- **Agent 1**: Will start improving EXIF extraction or adding GPS support
- **Agent 2**: Will start optimizing gallery filtering or adding lazy loading
- **Agent 3**: Will start improving upload progress or adding bulk operations
- **Agent 4**: Will start improving form validation or adding submission feedback

Each agent works continuously, validating as they go!
